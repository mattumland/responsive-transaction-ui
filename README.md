## Project Requirements
Build a UI that displays a customerâ€™s bank account and routing
numbers, available and pending balances, and transactions.

* UI for displaying, concealing, and copying account and routing numbers
* UI for displaying the current and available balance
* UI for displaying transactions
* README that explains your decisions and design choices and also includes instructions
on how to run the application.
* Technology requirements: Build the web app using React. The rest is up to you!

## Installation
THIS IS THE SETUP SECTION

react
typescript
tailwind
headless ui

## Design & Wireframe
I used backpack branding (colors, logo, fonts - derived from inspecting the site) and design to develop a basic design system. From there I created simple wireframe, starting with a mobile and then desktop view.

### Fonts
Header Font - [Archivo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo)
Body Font - [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat )


### Tailwind organization
1. Display
2. Color
3. Size
4. Margin, border, padding


## Data

Promise.All to get the data the fastest.
Not much gained by separate loading states, might as well get them all the together
A little prop drilling but not too much (show the specific drop drilling)
